# RaySwiftenstein
Raylib + Swift + Wolfenstein3D

Project is very early development stage, inspiration is [Nick Lockwood's Retro Rampage](https://github.com/nicklockwood/RetroRampage) series.

Only one dependency that project will have will be actual [Raylib binding](https://github.com/STREGAsGate/Raylib) for Swift.

Idea is to built retro style engine with ray cast rendering, with Raylib media layer. 
To be runnable on any device where Swift can build and run, platform layer will be handled by Raylib.
Make levels and sounds to be as max customizable as possible.

Project is just side-project for educational purposes, to learn low-level game programming with beautiful tool, [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and favorite language [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift)
